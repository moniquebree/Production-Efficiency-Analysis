# 🏭 Production Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing manufacturing efficiency through data visualization. By analyzing production output, downtime, and operational metrics, this dashboard helps identify bottlenecks and improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks production volume against targets.
* **Downtime Analysis:** Identifies the root causes of operational stoppages.
* **Trend Forecasting:** Visualizes output trends to predict future capacity needs.
* **Python Integration:** Includes an `analysis.py` script used for pre-processing raw production logs before visualization.
